# Tirelire üí∞

Tirelire is an app that enable users to follow their bank account activity and to classify their bank operations easily with machine learning models.

The app was first designed to help me to follow my account activity but it slowly ends up as a full featured app. I learned a lot about product design, software development, security and severals tools such as Redis.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Generate the private/public key üîê
In order to sign the token for authorization and authentification, you need to generate a private and a public key.
The following command will help you to get those keys :
```sh
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out private-key.pem 
openssl ec -in private-key.pem -pubout -out public-key.pem 
```
You can share `public-key.pem` to all your services. `private-key.pem` should remains to `tirelire-auth` only.

### Run all the services with docker üê≥

Once the previous steps are done, you'll be able to run all the services with docker
```
docker-compose up
```
